Install Playwright Browsers

cd frontend
pnpm exec playwright install

This will download Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit (about 500MB total). It takes a few minutes.

After Installation, Run Tests Again

# From project root

./dev.sh test:e2e

Or if you want to test just one browser to start:

cd frontend
pnpm exec playwright test --project=chromium

Quick Command for You

Run this now:

cd /Users/thomaskamsker/Documents/Atom/vron.one/playground/A1Reqmgmnt/a1ghreqmgmnt/frontend && pnpm exec playwright install

Then after installation completes:

cd .. && ./dev.sh test:e2e

The 110 tests will run across all browsers (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit, Mobile Chrome, Mobile Safari) and you'll see which ones pass!

To watch tests interactively instead:

./dev.sh test:e2e:ui

This opens a visual interface where you can see exactly what's happening in each test, including the 400 error you're debugging! 🎭
